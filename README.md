conway.hs
=========

Conway's [Game of Life][gol], implemented in Haskell!



Compile & Run
-------------

To compile and run:

    $ ghc conway.hs
    $ ./conway



Playing the Game
----------------

By default, the game begins with a lone glider, venturing out over the barren
cells of infinity...

If this is too sad for your pathetic human heart to bear, then edit the `main`
monad at the top of `conway.hs`, changing `glider` in the line:

    main = playGame glider


to any of the (currently 3) built-in initial
boards, defined at the bottom of the file:

* `blinker` - a line of 3 cells, which rotates or blinks every turn
* [`glider`][glider] - the simplest spaceship
* `lwss` - a slightly larger spaceship.


Otherwise you can define your own boards, and use them!




How it Works
------------

We'll ignore `Â¡EL MONSTER GRAPHICS ENGINE!` in the source code for now, since,
it's somewhat ah.. incomplete, shall we say?

No, no, the magic all happens in the `iterateBoard` function! When you feed it a
non-empty board, it gleefully generates a list of all the cells in that board
which could change in the next turn.

For each of those cells, it counts up how many of its neighbours are alive right
now, and applies Conway's rules of life, in the `iterateCell` function:

* If a living cell has less than 2 neighbours, it dies of
    loneliness (cue: 'Awwww's!)
* If it has more than 3 neighbours, then they step on each others toes or
    something - and the poor cell dies then, too!
* But if a living cell has just 2 or 3 neighbours, everything is fine and dandy.
* In fact, if an empty cell has exactly 3 neighbours, then something beautiful
    happens - a living cell appears between the 3 of them (it's acceptable in
    some cultures!)

And after chewing through all the cells, applying these rules, `iterateBoard`
spits out a new board. Well, almost. It throws away all those pesky dead cells
which were hanging around, and using up space, with the `onlyActiveCells`
function, so we can forget about them (although may we never forget their
sacrifice, etc. etc.)

Everything else is really just a (complicated, computationally inefficient...)
helper function! Just the definitions down the page to get to the bottom of it
all, so to speak...
